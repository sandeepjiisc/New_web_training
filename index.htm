				<h3>Vibration energy harvesting:</h3>
				<p>This project deals with energy harvesting from the vibration, which is obtained from the mechanical systems<br>
				or even from the ambient environment. It is one of the noble way of scavenging energy from surrounding. The<br>
				energy so produced can be used to power the wireless sensors, many small devices used in hostile<br> 
				environmental condition, used to charge batteries and many more. Here attention is concentrated on the<br>
                vibration analysis of the system using Matlab and Ansys softwares. It also includes designing of the<br> 
                prototypes. Here the basic element for energy harvestings are piezoelectric crystals.</p>

				<h2 id="a3">BE project:</h2>
				<h3>Analysis and fabrication of air-cooler cum air-conditioning system using solar energy-</h3>
				In this project attempt has been made by us to make a prototype of a device, which proves to be useful for the<br> 
				common peoples, to have a sense of comfort in summer season. Here we have make a product which is in<br> 
				between air-conditioner and air-cooler and performing at much less expense as compared to ACâ€™s by utilizing<br> 
				solar energy. Here we have fitted vapour compression refrigeration cycle in normal air-cooler, which chills<br> 
				out water, and due to this cool water more cooling effect can be produced in normal home cooler. All this<br> 
				cooling system runs by utilizing solar energy, means cost of extra cooling is negligible in external electric<br> 
				load. We have built a prototype of it.
